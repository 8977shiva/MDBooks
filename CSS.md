# Cascading Style Sheet (1994):-

In  1994  CSS was  first proposed. By the end of  1996 the CSS1 was  ready there were many problem  to implement CSS to browsers. By the 1998 CSS2 was released. The CSS3 was  converted into **modules** it  relies on the concept of modules to provide  the specification and it  deals with   the concept of **local scope by default**. For  theses version each  feature  is  know by  it levels  there is no CSS4

## Elements

#### Replaced Elements

Replaced elements are those where the element’s content is replaced by something that is not directly represented by document content. Probably the most familiar HTML example is the **img** element, which is replaced by an image file external to the document itself. In fact, **img** has no actual content, as you can see in this simple example:

```html
<img src="smily.gif">
```

This markup fragment contains only an element name and an attribute. The element presents nothing unless you point it to some external content. If you point to a valid image file, the image will be placed in the document. If not, it will either display nothing or the browser will show a “broken image” placeholder. Similarly, the input element is also replaced—by a radio button, checkbox, or text input box, depending on its type.

#### Nonreplaced Elements

The majority of HTML elements are nonreplaced elements. This means that their content is presented by the user agent inside a box generated by the element itself. For example, 

```html
<span>hi there</span>
```

 is a nonreplaced element, and the text “hi there” will be displayed by the user agent.

#### Block-level Elements

Block-level elements generate an element box that fills its parent element’s content area and cannot have other elements at its sides. In other words, it generates“breaks” before and after the element box. Some of the  block-Level Elements are  p, div,  unordered list and  ordered list.

#### Inline-level Elements

**Inline elements** don't start on a new line, they appear on the same line as the content and tags beside them. Some examples of **inline elements** are <span> , <strong>, and <img> tags. When it comes to margins and padding, browsers treat **inline elements** differently

## CSS and HTML Together

#### Link Tag

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="sheet1.css" media="all">
```

The  link tag is an  html tag from very long. We can link an external stylesheets which are not part of the  html. The link tag  must be place  inside the head to locate and the load the stylesheet  and render when ever required. **Attributes**:-  **rel** stands for 'relation' the value passed is the stylesheet relation. The attribute **type** is always set to text/CSS. This value describes the type of data that will be loaded using the link tag. That way, the web browser knows that the stylesheet is a CSS stylesheet,a fact that will determine how the browser deals with the data it imports. **href**  value of this attribute is the URL of your stylesheet. This URL can be either absolute or relative, depending on what works for you. 

#### Style  Element

```html
<style type="text/css">...</style>
```

The style element is one way to include a stylesheet. There should  always  use the attribute type. The style element is one way to include a stylesheet.

#### inline style

```html
<p style="color: gray;">hello world</p>
```

The inline CSS is also a method to insert style sheets in HTML document. This method mitigates some advantages of style sheets so it is advised to use this method sparingly. If you want to use inline CSS, you should use the style attribute to the relevant tag.

#### Import

```css
@import url(sheet2.css);
```

Just like link, @import can be used to direct the web browser to load an external stylesheet and use its styles in the rendering of the HTML document. The only major difference is in the syntax and placement of the command. As you can see, @import is found inside the style container. It must be placed before the other CSS rules or it
won’t work at all. we can also give external links

## Selector

#### Element Selector

we can select entire elements without any special characters. This applies to all  of the elements with that tag on the page. It  ranks on the  bottom of the specificity scale.

```css
p{ color:red}
```

#### Class Selector

This is used to select elements with a certain class name. Can be used on any and all elements with that class. Can be use multiple time, and is select with the  . symbol

```css
<h1 class="mainheading">Project</h1>
<sytle> 
.mainheading{
   color:blue
}
</style>
```

#### ID Selector

This is used to select elements with a certain Id name. Can be used on any and all elements with that ID. Unlike classes, it can only be used on one element at a time and is selected with the #  symbol. However, it is possible to use more than once

```css
<h1 id="mainheading">Project</h1>
<sytle> 
#mainheading{
   color:blue
}
</style>
```

#### Difference between ID and Class selector

ID selector are used  for unique  element. they have higher specificity  when compared to  class selectors

#### sibling selector

#### general sibling selector(~)

#### child selector >

#### descent selector 

#### Attribute Selectors  

 

##  Pseudo Selectors

#### hover

#### first-child

#### nth-child()

#### only-child

#### link

#### visited

#### checked
